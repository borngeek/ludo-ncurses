About
-----
<b>ludo-ncurses</b> is a NCURSES based Ludo game.


History
------
I started it when I was a graduate student. It was supposed to be capable of making automated moves. This is still in its development stage although I abandoned it. Evidently you'll find loads of bugs. One of the problem was with the rules of the game that acted as a major impediment for the development. I still don't know the rules completely. I no longer find interest in digging through the codes trying to make out what I wrote and so I am uploading it. Interested contributors can get this up and working.
